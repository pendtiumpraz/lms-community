## Reporting a Vulnerability

The LMS Community Platform team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:

üìß **pendtiumpraz@gmail.com**

Include the following information in your report:

1. **Description** - A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact** - What an attacker could potentially do
3. **Steps to Reproduce** - Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. **Proof of Concept** - Code, screenshots, or videos demonstrating the issue
5. **Suggested Fix** - If you have ideas on how to fix it (optional)
6. **Your Contact Information** - So we can follow up with you

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment** - We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours
- **Assessment** - We'll assess the vulnerability and determine its severity within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline** - We'll provide an estimated timeline for a fix within 5 business days
- **Updates** - We'll keep you informed of the progress toward resolving the issue
- **Credit** - If you wish, we'll acknowledge your contribution in the security advisory

### Security Update Process

1. Vulnerability is reported
2. We confirm and assess the vulnerability
3. We develop a fix
4. We test the fix thoroughly
5. We release a security update
6. We publish a security advisory

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

When contributing to this project, please follow these security practices:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- ‚úÖ Always validate user authentication on API routes
- ‚úÖ Check user roles before allowing access to resources
- ‚úÖ Use NextAuth's `getServerSession()` for server-side auth
- ‚úÖ Never trust client-side role checks alone

#### Input Validation
- ‚úÖ Validate all user inputs on the server side
- ‚úÖ Use Zod schemas for type-safe validation
- ‚úÖ Sanitize inputs before processing
- ‚úÖ Use Prisma's parameterized queries (automatic)

#### Environment Variables
- ‚úÖ Never commit `.env` files
- ‚úÖ Use `.env.example` as a template only
- ‚úÖ Store secrets in secure environment variable systems
- ‚úÖ Rotate credentials regularly

#### Database
- ‚úÖ Use Prisma ORM (prevents SQL injection)
- ‚úÖ Implement proper access controls
- ‚úÖ Enable SSL for production databases
- ‚úÖ Regular backups
- ‚úÖ Audit logs for sensitive operations

#### API Security
- ‚úÖ Implement rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS in production
- ‚úÖ Validate API request payloads
- ‚úÖ Return appropriate error codes
- ‚úÖ Don't expose sensitive information in errors

#### File Uploads
- ‚úÖ Validate file types
- ‚úÖ Limit file sizes
- ‚úÖ Scan files for malware
- ‚úÖ Use secure file storage (Google Drive)
- ‚úÖ Don't execute uploaded files

### For Deployers

When deploying this application:

#### Production Environment
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS only
- ‚úÖ Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- ‚úÖ Generate strong `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- ‚úÖ Use strong database passwords
- ‚úÖ Enable database SSL connections
- ‚úÖ Set up firewall rules
- ‚úÖ Regular security updates

#### Monitoring
- ‚úÖ Set up error monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
- ‚úÖ Monitor failed login attempts
- ‚úÖ Track API rate limits
- ‚úÖ Log security events
- ‚úÖ Regular security audits

#### Backup & Recovery
- ‚úÖ Automated database backups
- ‚úÖ Test restore procedures
- ‚úÖ Encrypted backups
- ‚úÖ Off-site backup storage

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

1. **Authentication**
   - Uses NextAuth.js v4 with Google OAuth
   - Session stored in database
   - Automatic token refresh
   - CSRF protection enabled

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Middleware-based route protection
   - API route authorization checks

3. **Data Protection**
   - Prisma ORM prevents SQL injection
   - React prevents XSS by default
   - Environment variables for secrets

4. **File Security**
   - Files stored in Google Drive
   - File type validation
   - Size limits enforced
   - Access control per file

### Areas for Enhancement

Future security improvements planned:

- [ ] Implement rate limiting on API routes
- [ ] Add CAPTCHA for authentication
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Security headers (Helmet.js)
- [ ] API key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Automated security scanning
- [ ] Penetration testing

## Security Checklist for Deployment

Use this checklist before deploying to production:

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] `.env` file not committed to repository
- [ ] Strong `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` generated
- [ ] Database credentials are strong
- [ ] Google OAuth credentials configured correctly
- [ ] Production database has SSL enabled
- [ ] All sensitive endpoints protected with authentication

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Database backups configured
- [ ] Error monitoring set up
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled
- [ ] Incident response plan in place

## Dependency Security

We regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities automatically
npm audit fix

# Update all dependencies
npm update
```
