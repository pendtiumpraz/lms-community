### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow the coding standards below
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm run lint        # Check for linting errors
   npm run build       # Ensure build succeeds
   npm run test        # Run tests (if available)
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add user profile page"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid using `any` type
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

**Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Retrieves user profile by ID
 * @param userId - The unique identifier of the user
 * @returns Promise resolving to user profile or null
 */
async function getUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<User | null> {
  return await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: userId },
  });
}
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop types with TypeScript
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful component names
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

**Example:**
```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export function Button({ variant, onClick, children, disabled }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
      className={cn('btn', `btn-${variant}`)}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### File Structure

- Place components in appropriate directories:
  - `src/components/shared/` - Reusable components
  - `src/components/dashboard/` - Dashboard-specific
  - `src/components/public/` - Public-facing components
- Keep related files together
- Use index.ts for barrel exports

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Use the cn() utility for conditional classes
- Maintain consistent spacing and sizing

### API Routes

- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Return consistent response formats
- Include proper error handling
- Add authentication/authorization checks

**Example:**
```typescript
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  try {
    const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
    if (!session) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
    }

    const data = await fetchData();
    return NextResponse.json({ data }, { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```
