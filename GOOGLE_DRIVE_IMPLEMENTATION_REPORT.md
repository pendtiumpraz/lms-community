## Technical Details

### Google Drive Folder Structure

Files are automatically organized in Google Drive:

```
LMS-Community/
├── Courses/
│   ├── {course-id-1}/
│   │   ├── materials/
│   │   ├── assignments/
│   │   └── submissions/
│   └── {course-id-2}/
│       ├── materials/
│       ├── assignments/
│       └── submissions/
└── Payments/
    └── payment-proofs/
```

### Authentication Flow

1. User signs in with Google OAuth
2. Access and refresh tokens stored in database
3. Tokens automatically refreshed when expired
4. All API calls use user's tokens for Drive access

### File Upload Flow

1. User selects/drops files in UI
2. Client validates file type and size
3. File sent to API endpoint via FormData
4. Server validates permissions and file
5. File converted to Buffer
6. File uploaded to Google Drive (specific folder)
7. File metadata saved to database
8. Success response with file URLs

### Security Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**
  - SUPER_ADMIN: Full access
  - TEACHER: Upload to own courses
  - STUDENT: Upload submissions and payment proofs
  - FINANCE: View payment proofs

- **File Validation**
  - Type checking (MIME types)
  - Size limits (10-100MB based on type)
  - Name sanitization

- **Permission Management**
  - Public files for free preview materials
  - Private files for enrolled students only
  - Restricted access to submissions

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Features

1. **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google OAuth
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **File Validation**: Type and size checking
4. **SQL Injection**: Prisma ORM protection
5. **XSS Protection**: React auto-escaping
6. **CSRF Protection**: NextAuth built-in
7. **Secure Storage**: Google Drive with permissions
8. **Token Refresh**: Automatic token refresh

- [ ] Add virus scanning for uploaded files
- [ ] Implement file name sanitization
- [ ] Add IP-based access controls
- [ ] Enable 2FA for admin accounts
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity

---

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation

2. **Concurrent Uploads**: Currently sequential
3. **Video Processing**: No transcoding or optimization
4. **Search**: Basic file search, no full-text search
5. **Versioning**: No file version history
6. **Collaboration**: No real-time collaboration features

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- [ ] File sharing with expiration dates
- [ ] Download statistics and analytics
- [ ] File preview for more types (PPT, Excel)
- [ ] Video transcoding for streaming
- [ ] Image optimization and resizing
- [ ] Folder-based organization in UI
- [ ] File tagging and categorization

### Nice-to-Have Features

- [ ] File comments and annotations
- [ ] Collaborative editing
- [ ] File comparison tools
- [ ] Advanced permission management
- [ ] Integration with other cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure)
- [ ] Offline file access
- [ ] Mobile app support

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

**"File size too large"**
- Check size limits for endpoint
- Compress files before upload

**"Permission denied"**
- Verify user role
- Check course ownership
- Verify enrollment status
